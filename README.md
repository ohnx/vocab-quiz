# vocab

give it a json, get a vocab quiz.

i made this to prep for my SAT.

quite frankly, I didn't need to at all (read: this didn't help). There were hard words, but the only way to learn them is to always use weird and esoteric (;D) words. I suppose this could help in that sense.

the last old SAT is jan 23, apparently (I might be wrong). After that, it's the new SAT. This will probably be less useful after that. Still, you can use it as a quiz in general.

JSON should look like this:

```
[
{"word":"word1", "definition":"def1"},
{"word":"word2", "definition":"def2"}
]
```
